    <center> <p class = "seniorTips">
      <b>• START COLLEGE APPLICATIONS EARLY!</b><br> <br>
     <b>• Don’t stress too much, try to have fun and stress healthy.</b> <br><br>
     <b>• Fill out the FAFSA early!</b> <br><br>
     <b>• Have fun, hang out with your friends a lot.</b> <br><br>
     <b> • Start reflecting on yourself.</b> <br><br>
     <b>• Know when to take breaks and relax.</b> <br>
        The journey to graduation is a tough one and mentally draining. Know when to relax and take breaks so that your mental health doesn’t suffer too much.
        And if you feel overwhelmed and depressed, make sure you talk to someone and have an outlet. <br><br>
     <b>• Make your activities list in a separate doc and keep adding to it.</b> <br>
       The amount of times you will have to put in your activities is astronomical. Make it easy on yourself and make an activities' doc you can just copy and paste from! Make sure to include the activity, your role, the amount of hours you spent on it, and the dates you participated. Add your volunteer activities on there too! <br><br>
     <b>• Show demonstrated interest early.</b><br>
       Demonstrated interest is important in college admissions (some schools don’t consider it, like Yale for example. Be sure to do your research to see if the schools your applying for consider it) You can show demonstrated interest in emailing your admissions officer, attending an information session, and applying to fly-in programs! <br><br>
     <b>• Take everything in <br></b>
       This is your last year of high school and while it may feel like its taking forever to end, when its over for real it will feel like time flew by. So take everything in, be in the moment. Soak in the laughs at the cafeteria table, as well as the terrible food. Talk to your favorite teacher, go to your school events (of course only if you actually like your school), and spend as much time with your friends as possible). <br></p></center>

        <b>• Reach out to your teachers for recommendations.</b> You will need two recommendations for college, preferably both from core classes (science, math, english, or social studies), and you should select teachers whose classes you performed well in and established a relationship with. When you request a letter of recommendation, it is recommended that you attach a resume or “brag sheet”. <br><br>
          <b>• Begin working on your personal statement.</b> This is the essay that will define you throughout college applications, and will go to every single college that you apply to. This essay should share an experience or experiences that have shaped you throughout your high school years. It’s important to get it done early so that you can have it edited. <br><br>
          <b> • Apply to fly-in programs.</b> Fly-in programs are campus visitation programs (typically for selective colleges) designed for first-generation, low-income, and/or students of color, and are at a variety of colleges, including University of Pennsylvania, Barnard College, and more. Even if you are not accepted, you will have shown interest in the college and got experience writing essays very similar to the regular college application essays. <br><br>
          <b>• Secure your college list and begin signing up for college interviews.</b> College interviews can only add to your application, and allow for a more “human” look at you and your admission. We recommend you practice interview questions with a friend, parent, or adult mentor beforehand so that you can formulate mature responses that represent you well. <br><br>

          <b>• Begin interacting with colleges you’re interested in more heavily.</b> If possible, visit the college on campus and participate in a tour, but if not, you always have the option of virtual visits and information sessions. <br><br>
          <b>• Consider what application route you plan on partaking on.</b> If you’re low-income, you may want to consider applying through the Questbridge National Match, a full-scholarship program with over 40 colleges to apply to. You may also want to consider if you are planning on doing Early Decision (ED) or REA (Restrictive Early Action) anywhere, and figure out how that aligns with your plans. For example, if you do Early Decision, you cannot participate in the QuestBridge National College Match nor apply anywhere REA.  <br><br>
