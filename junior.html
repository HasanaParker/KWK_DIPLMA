    <h4> Tips For Junior Year </h4>

   <p class = "juniorTips"> <b>• Keep your grades up! <br></b>
     Junior year grades are often the most important grades on your transcript (all grades are important by the way, so if you're a freshman reading this, do not slack on your grades!).<br><br>
    <b>• Be confident in yourself! <br></b>
     A good amount of my junior year was spent not being confident in myself and I missed out on so many opportunities because of that. <br><br>
   <b>• Explore new things! Try everything! <br></b>
     There are so many things out there for you to learn about and explore. Next Year you will constantly be asked what you are passionate about and what you want to do when you're older, and you may have no idea, and that's okay! You don’t have to know right now. So explore everything and grow out your interest. <br><br>
   <b>• Continue taking rigorous courses. <br></b>
     Good grades are important and having As for regular courses is fine, but it’s even better to have good grades for rigorous courses. Just to show schools that you challenged yourself!<br><br>
  <b> • Start thinking about what you want for your future. <br></b>
     Now you don’t have to know everything but have an idea of whether you want to go to college and what you’re interested in majoring in, these decisions can help you decide what you want in a college whether you want to go to a trade school, or straight into the job market. Don’t put too much pressure onto these decisions because you can always change your mind later. <br> <br>
   <b>• Get super close to your teachers this year. <br></b>
     Your junior year teachers will be the ones who write your letters of recommendation for college. If you want an awesome letter, form great relationships with them. <br><br></p>

      <b> • Start working on a college list and research the colleges on your list thoroughly.</b> Your college list should be balanced with safeties, targets, and reaches. If you are a low-income student, you should make sure almost all, if not all, of the colleges on your list meet full-need, meaning that they are accessible for low-income students. <br><br>
      <b> • Take the SAT or ACT if you can.</b> Many colleges are beginning to become test-optional, but a good score never hurts! If you score over a 1250 on the SAT, you should continue to study and dedicate time in order to see if you can score higher. If you get less, no worries, just move on from the SAT and dedicate your time to other pursuits! <br><br>
      <b> • Consider applying to summer programs</b> like Kode with Klossy, Smith College’s Pre-College programs, and the TERP Young Scholars Program. These are a good way to spend your summer learning actively while also making exciting connections with peers from across the United States! <br><br>
